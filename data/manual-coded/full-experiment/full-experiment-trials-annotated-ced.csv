I actually got the answer in my head and was working it out, but ran out of time. So, let's see here. I need to get to 4. If I want to do 8 times 3, I would have to get those numbers 13, 5, and 6 somehow equal 3. And I don't think I can do that, so let's explore other options. 13 minus 5 is 8, so 8 plus 8 is 16, and then plus 6 would be 22, and I'd be missing 2. So, 13 minus 6 is 7. No, that wouldn't work out. It needs to be divisible by... 4 and 8. So, um, let's see. 8 times 6 is 48, and that would leave me with 13 and 15, which I can't really do much with. So, um... What's 13 times 5? Let me see. 65. And 8 times 6 is 48. That would not work. 5 plus 8 is 13. 13 plus 13 is 26. Gosh, I feel like every time there's a 5, it throws things off. Um... Uh... 24 minus 13 is 11. That's 11. That would not work. 5 plus 6 is 11. Plus 8 is 19. 20... 19 plus 13 is 32. It's too big. So... How about 13 minus 6 plus 5 is 12, plus 8 is 20.

Um, yeah, I'm trying here. So 49, um, well if you subtract. So it's 7 times 7 is 49 minus 16. No, 28 plus 4. But 28 plus 3. I keep getting that stupid pop-up and I hate that. Um, 7 plus 4 is 11. That's great. Just wonderful. 7 plus 7 is 14. 7 minus 4 is 3. 7 minus 4 is 3 times 7 plus 4. Ooh. 7 times 4 minus, no, 7 plus 4 is 11. 7 times 3 is 21. Then you'd have to add a 3. So then I can't do that. So if I take 7 and a minus 4 times 7, that's 21. Yeah, that's not helpful. Um, 7 times 4 is 28. I don't know how to use these 7s. I'm just staring at the numbers. I'm thinking 4 and 4 is 1. Or it's 8. 8. And times, no, 8 plus. Well, if you just add them all together, you get 22. Which is not the number. So you have to multiply something. So I think we have to multiply 7 and 4. So I'm going to start with that. That's 28. But then there's a problem. Because 7 and 4, so maybe, maybe it's 4 times 4. Maybe it's 16 plus 14.

Dude, I'm saying my thoughts out loud, I don't know, like, if it's recording, can you hear me? Why was there no test record? Okay, 11, wait, because 8 minus 4 plus 3 would be 1 times 11, it would only be 11, or 12, if you add those, and then, if you add them all together, that's way too much, if you add 11 plus 3 is 14, plus 4 is only 8 minus 4, 14 plus 4, 18, 14, 14, plus 8, 22, wait, this is so hard, can I give up? I don't know, okay, okay, 8 minus 3, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16 plus 4, that's only 20, 3 times 2 is 12, 4 times 8 is 32, wait, 32 minus 11, I think this is it, 4 times 8, Thank you.",1,192,"```python

Oh, okay, can't really use numbers, so. 2 times 3, 6 times 7, no. 2 plus 7, no. 7 minus 3 would be 4 and 2, no. 7 minus 3 would be 4 and 2, no. 7 minus 3 would be 4 and 2, no. 7 minus 3 would be 4 and 2, no. I feel like it's definitely 10 divided by 5 as part of it. But 10 minus 3, 7 times 7, no. 7 plus 7, plus 5, only 19. 17. 17 plus 15, no. 17 plus 5, plus 3, too much.
